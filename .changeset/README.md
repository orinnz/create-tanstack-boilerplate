# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a tool to help you manage versioning and changelogs.

## How to use

1.  **Make changes** to your codebase.
2.  **Run `npx changeset`** (or `npm run changeset`).
3.  **Select the packages** you want to release (usually just one).
4.  **Select the bump type** (major, minor, patch).
5.  **Write a summary** of the changes.

This will create a markdown file in this folder. When you push this to GitHub, the release action will see it and create a "Version Packages" PR. Merging that PR will publish the new version!
